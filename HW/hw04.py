HW_Python_User_Defined_Function_With_Parameter:

Step 1: Create a file name hw04.py inside the HW folder

Step 2: Now create an User defined function with parameters name, areaOfTriangle. The formula of Triangle is 1/2 x base x height.

Step 3: Use statement inside this function to get the area of a Trangle. Expected outcome would be: The Area of Triangle is <value>

Step 4: Call the function areaOfTriangle and use arguments as your choice for the value of base and height to make sure the formula is working.

Step 5: Copy the code and paste it below.

HW_Python_User_Input_In_Defined_Function_With_Parameter:

Step 1: Inside hw04.py file, create another User defined function with parameters name, areaOfParallelogram. The formula of Parallelogram is base x height.

Step 2: For base and height, we will use the feature "Python User Input", so an user can put value of base and height in Terminal or console. Can we input int value which can work on above formula? what kind of change is necessary for input function while declaring base and height? Please implement so.

Step 3: Use statement inside this function to get the area of a Parallelogram. Expected outcome would be: The Area of Parallelogram is <value>

Step 4: Call the function, areaOfParallelogram and use arguments as value of base and height to make sure the formula is working. Make sure you can type in Console/Terminal and get the correct outcome from the formula.

Step 5: Copy the code and paste it below.
