HW_Python_Condition_With_User_Input:

Step 1: Create a file name hw06.py inside the HW folder
Step 2: For temperature variable, we will use the feature "Python User Input". Inside the input function, type "Today's Temperature: ". so an user can put value of today's temperature in Terminal when the file is executed.
Step 3: Now create an User defined function name, "todaysTemperature" where the parameter is "temperature" . Inside the function, put below conditions sequentially.
Step 4: If the temperature is less than 32, then print "Freezing"
Step 5: If the temperature is less than 55, then print "Pleasant"
Step 6: If the temperature is less than 73, then print "Getting Warmer"
Step 7: If the temperature is less than 101, then print "Hot"
Step 8: If the temperature is greater than or equal to 101, print "Very Hot"
Step 9: And finally print "Please put a valid temperature" where no condition present.
Step 10: In the above 5 conditions, use the appropriate keyword like if, elif, else to execute today's Temperature condition.
Step 11: Now Call the function with the parameter and Run the code. Type today's temperature in the Termial, and find the correct condition of the today's weather.
Step 12: Please organize the code.
Step 13: Copy the code and paste it below.
