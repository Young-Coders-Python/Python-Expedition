# Python has two primitive loop commands: while loops, for loops

# Initilization block: i=1
# Conditional block: i<10
# Incremental or Decremental block


# Incremental block: i+=1, incremented by 1, you can also write i = i+1
# Incremental block: i+=2, incremented by 2, you can also write i = i+2
# Incremental block: i+=3, incremented by 3, you can also write i = i+3

# Decremental block: i-=1, decremented by 1, you can also write i = i-1
# Decremental block: i-=2, decremented by 2, you can also write i = i-2
# Decremental block: i-=3, decremented by 3, you can also write i = i-3


# incremental
i = 1
while i<10:
    print(i)
    i+=2

# 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

# decremental
i=20
while i>6:
    print (i)
    i-=3

# 20, 17, 14, 11, 8,
